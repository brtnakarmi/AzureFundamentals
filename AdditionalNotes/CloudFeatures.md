# Cloud Features of Public CLoud

- Scalability: The ability of a cloud-based system or application to handle an increase in load or demand by automatically allocating additional resources (such as computing power, storage, or bandwidth). This allows the system or application to continue operating smoothly and effectively, even when faced with sudden spikes in traffic or usage.

- Fault tolerance: The ability of a cloud-based system or application to continue operating normally, even if one or more of its components fail. This is achieved through the use of redundant components and self-healing systems that can automatically detect and recover from failures.

- Disaster recovery: The ability of a cloud-based system or application to recover from a major disruption or disaster, such as a natural disaster or cyberattack. This typically involves replicating data and systems in multiple locations and implementing failover mechanisms to ensure that the system or application can continue operating in the event of a disaster.

- Elasticity: The ability of a cloud-based system or application to scale up or down its resources in response to changes in demand. This allows the system or application to be highly flexible and adaptable, and to optimize its resource usage for cost efficiency.

- High availability: The ability of a cloud-based system or application to provide continuous, reliable access to its services, even in the event of failures or disruptions. This is typically achieved through the use of redundant components and failover mechanisms.

- Agility: The ability of a cloud-based system or application to quickly and easily adapt to changing business needs or requirements. This can be achieved through the use of flexible, scalable, and easily deployable cloud resources.

- Economy of scale: The ability of a cloud-based system or application to take advantage of the economies of scale offered by the cloud provider. This can result in lower costs, higher efficiency, and better resource utilization.
